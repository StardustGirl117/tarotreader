# tarotreader
Site to allow tarot card inputs and generate text outputs based on the information you enter
I would really like to develop a site that helps you understand and read your cards all at once. This is not something that will 
generate a reading for you. You complete the reading IRL, but when I do my readings, I find my biggest struggle is having to 
look up each card meaning through 3 pages filled with adds and then read the meaning of ONE card, when there are often 10. When I 
get to the end of reading, half of the time, I don't even know what my first card was, and I have completely forgotten the context
that it was in. 
I think that being able to read all of your card values / meanings in one sitting would be super helpful for information presentation.
We'll see if it goes further ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
